/**
 * Class responsible for configuring AMQP RPC communication.
 * 
 * Currently used to fetch user login info from user-service as an alternative to REST HTTP calls.
 * 
 * In the future, consider moving to a CQRS pattern to completely avoid having microservices communicate with one another to query data.
 * In this particular example, auth-service would subscribe to changes in the user-service (create/update/delete) and manage its own copy of the data.
